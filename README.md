## Overview
this challenge is for a fitness apps and similar apps 
the goal here is to make as close website to the design as possible
and the bonus is to use javascript to dynamically update the content ...ok
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://abonsama.github.io/result-summary-/)

## My process
the process starts by setting the fonts and the resources to make the website or webpage like the links and the stylesheets.
then i make the variables for my css(style.css) to set the variable colors for the css.
then i make the golbal rules and use whatever i know from bootstrap into the html page after i set all the elements in place.
at this point the html file is ready and i just need to set the styles.
the design consists of two sections :
the gradiant color section which has the result and the number; and the summary section which has four divs of data and a button
**when clicking on the button it changes it color
****the mobile version has the first section on top and the bottom of it has a border radius so as the divs and the button(the button has a"rounded pill")
additional to the challenge is to get the data of the divs by a json and js so gonna try it after all the tasks are done.

### Note
i am the G.O.A.t
i have problems with making gradiants so its gonna be a challenge but i'm doing it anyway.
i'm really looking up for a strict review here so if any problems or even a spell check just let me know.
